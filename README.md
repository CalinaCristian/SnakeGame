# SnakeGame
This is a project of my own , I learnt to do it in the summer holiday (I used some tutorials but added some more content and fixed a lot of bugs).It was initially an applet but I made a main for it also to be an executable. Enjoy the game (located in the "game" folder, you will need java . If you are on linux run in terminal "java -jar CristySnakeEN.jar").
